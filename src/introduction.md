# Introduction

This book is a collection of notes on the use and programming of the Sharp PC-1500 pocket computer.
We assume the reader has access to a Sharp PC-1500 or an emulator such as [PockEmul](https://pockemul.com/),
which can even be accessed from a web browser [here](https://pockemul.com/OL/pockemul.html).

These notes are taken from different sources such as the [Sharp PC-1500 Instruction Manual](https://pockemul.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PC1500_OM_EN.pdf).
