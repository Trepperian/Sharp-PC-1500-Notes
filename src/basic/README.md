# The BASIC programming language

The Sharp PC-1500 can be programmed using the BASIC programming language.

To write our program we first need to enter the `programming` mode, to do this simply press
the `mode` key until the `PRO` indicator is displayed above the screen.

Now the computer is ready to accept our program, lets start with the classical `Hello, World!` program.
The program is introduced line by line, so first we introduce the following input.

```basic
10 PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
```

The spaces are optional, they make the program more readable, but could slow you down when typing.

When you are done introducing the line, press the `enter` key to accept it.
The first number in the line is the line number, it is used to reference the line in the program, and is mandatory.
After the line number we have the statement, in this case `PRINT`, which prints the string that follows it,
in this case `"HELLO, WORLD!"`.

Now we can run the program, to do this, press the `MODE` key until the `RUN` prompt is displayed above the screen.
Then press enter the following command.

```basic
RUN
```

The program will run and display the `HELLO, WORLD!` message on the screen.
